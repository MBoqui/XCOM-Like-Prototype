Game Instructions:
- The W, A, S and D keys move the camera.
- On your turn you can click one of your units to select it.
- With a unit selected you can click an enemy unit to shoot it or an empty space on the map to move there.
- When hovering the mouse over an enemy unit or the map, the tips on the bottom of the screen show how many action points (AP) are required to shoot or move and the hit chance of the attack.
- If an unit doesn't have enough AP, it cannot perform any actions until the players next turn.
- The game ends when there is only one player left.
